## 📌 NovaCraft Studio – Dynamic Website Redesign

Modernization of the NovaCraft Studio showcase website, an agency specializing in graphic design and UI/UX.
The goal is to convert the static site (HTML/CSS/Tailwind) into a **partially dynamic** PHP website — **without a database** in this first phase.
